# That's not _our_ model of unemployment

We will focus on a more .hl[intricate] model of unemployment. 
--
Firms set prices to make profits. They will optimally choose how much of this to share with their workers. 

Labourers have the choice of working or not. Jobs pay them more than reservation wages, meaning they earn .hl[employment rents]. 


- Firms .color1[cannot perfectly observe] their employees.
- We will analyze this as an .hl[Incomplete Contracts] game.
- We will see how this setup can lead to .color5[unemployment].

# Agenda for this topic

* Study firms as producers of differentiated products
* Study employees and employers in a .color1[Principal-Agent model]
* Learn about **game theory** and the .color3[Nash Equilbrium]
* Model price-setting .hl[and] wage-setting behaviour of firms, which determines .hl[economy-wide unemployment] rate and real wage
* Explain why unemployment exists *even in equilibrium*
* Show how .color3[the government] can affect wages and unemployment by its policies
* Analyse the role of **labour unions**


_Note_ this will involve wage-setting **and** price-setting components. We won't get to price-setting today.

# Definition of *unemployed*

The **unemployed** are the people who: 

1.    Are not in paid employment or self-employment
1.    Are available for work 
1.    Are actively seeking work

# Firms

# Context for studying firms

In models of economic interactions, **bargaining determines the division of social surplus**. 

All parties gain from these interactions, but have .hl[conflicting interests] over how these gains (profits) are shared.

* How are wages determined within firms?
* What are the economy-wide effects of firm interactions?

---

# What is a firm?

Firm = a business organisation which

* Employs people
* Purchases inputs to produce market goods and services
* Sets prices greater than the cost of production

<blockquote>The firm in a capitalist economy is a miniature, privately owned, centrally planned economy</blockquote>

---

# Firms versus markets

In a capitalist economy, the .hl[division of labour] is coordinated in two ways: firms and markets.

Coordination within firm differs from coordination via markets:
* .color1[concentration of economic power] in the hands of the owners/managers allows them to issue commands to workers
* Power is .color1[decentralized] in markets, so decisions are autonomous and voluntary

Please note: pro-market is not the same thing as pro-business!

---

# Within firms, there are conflicts

In the vast majority of firms, there is .color1[separation of ownership and control].

Managers ≠ owners, and managers ≠ employees. These groups have **different incentives**.

---

## Within firms, there is asymmetric information

The firm’s **profits** legally belong to the people who own the firm’s assets.

* Managers’ actions have impact on profits...
* ...but if profits increase thanks to managers’ work, they will not automatically benefit. 

This creates a .hl[conflict of interest] between managers and owners.

Perfect competition assumes everyone .hl[atomistic consumers] who are .color3[perfectly informed].

One area of economics that studies stituations where your payoffs depend on others' actions is .color1[**game theory**]. Payoffs are interdependent, like we said the macroeconomy is.

There's been a robbery. The cops have arrested two culprits, both with long histories of crime. 
The prisoners are held in different locations. The cops sit down to interview them.

# Game Theory and Nash Equilibrium

In game theory, if everyone is playing their best response to the strategies of everyone else, these strategies are termed a .color1[Nash equilibrium].

# Let's pull this back to firms

---

## How do firms address asymmetric information?

A lot of effort goes into .hl[aligning interests] within firms. For example,

1. Monitor the managers’ performance
1. Link the managers’ pay to the performance of the company’s share price

These may seem obvious, but only arise because of the conflict of interest.

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Employees

---

## This conflict permeates down the chain

Employees also have incentives that deviate from their employers.

Contracts are typically .color5[incomplete]:
* some tasks depend on future (unknown) events
* some aspects of the job are difficult to measure and base wages on e.g. effort

An **incomplete contract** does not specify, in an enforceable way, every aspect of the exchange that affects the interests of parties.

---

# Workers' effort

If firms can’t directly measure effort, why do workers work hard?

*    work ethic
*    feelings of responsibility 
*    to reciprocate a feeling of gratitude for good working conditions
*    benefits for measurable output
*    promotions
*    fear of being fired

---
# Workers' effort

If firms can’t directly measure effort, why do workers work hard?

*    work ethic
*    feelings of responsibility 
*    to reciprocate a feeling of gratitude for good working conditions
*    benefits for measurable output
*    promotions
*    **fear of being fired**

This will be our focus, our lens. Workers like getting paid, and don't want to lose their jobs.

This will be the .hl[Labour Discipline Model].

---
## In our model, employees earn "rents"

--
Employees fear getting fired when they are paid more than their .hl[reservation option] = they receive employment rent.

.color1[Employment rent] = cost of job loss, which includes
1. Lost income while searching for a job
1. Costs required to start a new job e.g. relocation
1. Loss of non-wage benefits e.g. medical insurance
1. Social costs (stigma of being unemployed)

Employment rent = wage – reservation wage – disutility of effort

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Labour Discipline Model

---

# Wages and Effort

The employer cannot directly measure the worker’s effort

Large employment rent → large cost of job loss → 
worker puts in more effort to reduce chance of getting fired
 
One way to increase the cost of job loss is for the firm to raise wages.

---

# The Employment "Game"

Rather than a "magic hat" of labour demand, we will model wages as a .color1[game].

1. The employer chooses a wage. As long as the worker works hard enough, she will keep her job at the offered wage. 
1. The worker chooses a level of work effort, taking into account the costs of losing her job if she does not provide enough effort.


Firms care about .hl[Profit] = Worker's output - Wage.

Workers care about .hl[Employment rent] = Wage - Disutility of Effort - Reservation Wage. 

---

# Consider an employee's best response

Consider the following **hypothetical**.

Let's say an employer first offers €300 a week. 
Contrast that to when an employer offers €400 a week.


Do we think effort:
.alphatype[
1. Goes up
1. Stays the same
1. Goes down
]

--

**It goes up.** In .hl[response] to a higher offered wage, workers .color1[increase] effort.

---

# Worker's Best Response Curve

**Best response curve** shows the optimal amount of effort workers will exert for each wage offered.

Represents the firm’s .color1[feasible frontier] for wages and effort


Slope of best response curve = **M**arginal **R**ate of **T**ransformation. This is a little bit like an elasticity (not quite the same).



---

# Worker's Best Response Curve
.center[.shrink500[![Worker Best Response](i/worker_br6.svg)]]

---


class: inverse, middle, center

# Okay, that's workers. What about employers?

---

# Firm’s best response

To maximise profits, firms want to .color1[minimise the costs of production].

Because there is a trade-off between wages and effort, the employer should .hl[find a feasible combination of effort and wage] that minimises the cost per unit of production.


---

# Isocost lines

**Iso** comes from the Greek for equal. Very similar to the Latin term *equi*.

An .color1[isocost line] is a line where costs are the same.

---
# Isocost lines for firms in the effort game
The .hl[cost of effort] is the same at all points on an isocost line.
.center[.shrink500[![Isocost for Effort](i/iso5.svg)]]
---


# Isocost lines for firms in the effort game

The .hl[cost of effort] is the same at all points on an isocost line. Slope of isocost curve = **MRS** = the rate at which the employer is willing to increase wages to get higher effort.
.center[.fitpage[![Isocost for Effort](i/isocost_firm.png)]]


---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Putting it together

---

# In search of equilibrium

Workers have their Marginal Rate of Transformation, **MRT**, converting wage offers into effort levels they're willing to exert.

Employers have their Marginal Rate of Substitution, **MRS**, measuring employers' willingness to increase wages to get higher effort.

---

# Determining wages

Profits are maximised at the steepest isocost line (i.e., lowest cost line), subject to the worker’s best response curve.

In equilibrium, **MRT = MRS**.

--

.hl[Efficiency wage theory] = wages set higher than the reservation wage so workers will care about losing the job and provide more effort. 

---
# Determining wages
In equilibrium, **MRT = MRS**.
.center[.shrink500[![Micro-equilibrium](i/u6equi5.svg)]]
---

# Involuntary unemployment

Involuntary unemployment = being out of work, but preferring to have a job at the wages and working conditions that otherwise identical employed workers have. 

There must .color1[always] be involuntary unemployment in the labour discipline model.

--
Why? In equilibrium, both wages and involuntary unemployment have to be high enough **to ensure employment rent is high enough** for workers to put in effort.

### Incorporating non-workers requires more work on firms' .hl[profit maximizing] decisions

---

# Firms have costs

Average costs (usually U-shaped in quantity), marginal costs (usually upward sloping), total costs (increasing in quantity).

To be profitable, they must set a Price per unit .color1[higher] than Average Cost per unit.


---

# Firms have customers

By testing sensitivity to price changes, firms can estimate their .color1[demand curve]

.center[.fitpage[![A firm's demand curve](i/demand.jpg)]]

.color1[Demand curve] = quantity that consumers will buy at each price.

---

# Firms care about profits

$$ \text{Profits = Total Revenue - Total Costs} $$

$$ = PQ - C(Q) $$

--

$$ = Q \times (P - AC) $$

The combinations of .color2[Price] and .color3[Quantity] that return the same profit are called **Isoprofit Curves**

---

# Firms care about profits

Isoprofit curves show price-quantity combinations that give the same profit. 


.center[.fitpage[![Isoprofits](i/isoprofits.svg)]]

Firms want to reach the .color1[highest feasible] Isoprofit Curve.

But recall that consumers care how much their wages actually buy.

---

# The real wage

The real wage is the nominal wage divided by the price level of the bundle of consumer goods purchased. (Like Real GDP!)

$$ \text{Real Wage} = \frac{W}{P} $$

1. .hl[Each firm] decides on its: price, wage, how many people to hire
1. Adding up all of these across .color1[all firms] gives the total employment in the economy and the real wage.

# Distribution of Output

The firm’s choice of profit-maximizing price also determines the firm’s optimal markup above the marginal cost of production.

$$ \text{Price} = \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Output}} + \frac{\text{Nominal Wage}}{\text{Output}} $$

For the economy as a whole, this translates into how output is distributed between the firm-owners and the workers.

$$ \frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Worker}} = \text{Real Profit} + \text{Real Wage}$$

--
or, equivalently,
$$ \text{Real Wage} =\frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Worker}} - \text{Real Profit} $$

---

# The **Price-Setting Curve**

Once firms set their prices, this determines the level of output and markup in the economy. This then pins down the real wage.

# The Labour Market's _Nash Equilibrium_

### The Nash equilibrium of the labour market is where the wage- and price-setting curves intersect. 

All parties are doing the best they can, given what everyone else is doing:

* The firms are offering the least wage to ensure workers’ effort  
* Employment is the highest it can be, given the wage 
* Those who have jobs cannot improve their situation by asking for higher pay or working less hard
* Those who do not have jobs would like to work, but cannot persuade firms to hire them by accepting lower wage (labour discipline concerns)

# Unemployment emerges from this model

**Unemployment** = _excess supply_ in the labour market.

* No unemployment → zero cost of job loss → no effort
* Therefore some unemployment is necessary to motivate workers
* These are the involuntarily unemployed

# Unemployment and aggregate demand

The firm’s demand for labour depends on the demand for their goods and services (<u>derived demand for labour</u>).

**Aggregate demand** = sum of the demand for all of the goods and services produced in the economy.

 The increase in unemployment caused by the fall in aggregate demand is called .color1[demand-deficient unemployment].

---
# Demand-deficient unemployment

# Demand-deficient unemployment

Low aggregate demand moves the economy from labour market equilibrium (X) to point B.

--

.hl[However], B is **not** a Nash equilibrium:

* Firms could lower wages
* Lower costs → lower prices
* Increase output and employment 

--

This would all happen automatically, right?

---

# Automatic adjustment

Point B is not a Nash equilibrium:

* Firms could lower wages without lowering workers’ effort
* Lower wages allow them to cut their prices 
* Lower prices stimulate demand → output rises
* Firms hire more workers to produce more

... .hl[unemployment falls back to X]
---
# Automatic adjustment in practice

Real economies do not function so smoothly:

* Workers resist cuts to their nominal wage (lower morale, strikes)
* Lower wages means people spend less → aggregate demand falls further    
* Falling prices across the economy may lead consumers to postpone their purchases in hope to get even better bargain later

---
# Government intervention
### The government could increase its own spending to expand aggregate demand.

.center[.fitpage[![Government intervention](i/92a.svg)]]
---
# Government intervention

At B, firms would find it optimal to produce more (and hire more workers) instead of reducing wages.

## Labour Supply – do immigrants lower wages? (Probably not, no)

## How Much Does Immigration Boost Innovation?
Hunt, Gauthier-Loiselle (2010, AEJ: Macro)
.enda-left[
We measure the extent to which skilled immigrants increase innovation in the United States. The 2003 National Survey of College Graduates shows that immigrants patent at double the native rate, due to their disproportionately holding science and engineering degrees. Using a 1940-2000 state panel, we show that a 1 percentage point increase in immigrant college graduates' population share increases patents per capita by 9-18 percent. Our instrument for the change in the skilled immigrant share is based on the 1940 distribution across states of immigrants from various source regions and the subsequent national increase in skilled immigration from these regions.

### One useful ways to measure inequality are the **Gini coefficient**

If all income goes to one person, the Gini Coefficient is 1.

If income is distributed perfectly evenly (e.g. 10% of the population get 10% of the income), the Gini Coefficiency is 0.

# Labour Unions

Labour union = an organization consisting predominantly of employees. Its main activities include the .color1[negotiation of rates of pay] and conditions of employment for its members.

# Wage Bargaining

Where workers are organized into trade unions, the wage is not set by the employer but instead is negotiated between union and firm. 

The **bargained wage** can be above the wage-setting curve
* the wage-setting curve is about the employer’s threat of firing a worker
* the union can threaten to “dismiss” the employer by .u[going on strike]

---
# Bargained wage setting curve

**Bargained wage setting** curve indicates the wage that the union-employer bargaining process will produce for every level of employment. 

Its position above the wage-setting curve depends on .u[the relative bargaining power] of the union and the employer.

## Here's one way to view union bargaining

## Traditional view of union bargaining

Unions demand higher wages from employer.

# Union Voice Model as a Game

Unlike the Prisoner's Dilemma, imagine this game is played every day for 20 years.

The **Nash Equilibrium** is {Go on Strike, Mean Boss}. But if both parties know fighting is counter-productive in the long-run, working together and playing nice might sustain.

### Equilibrium Selection in the Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma

Blonski _et al_ (AEJ:Micro, 2011)

.enda-left[
We propose an axiomatic approach for equilibrium selection in the discounted, infinitely repeated symmetric Prisoner's Dilemma. Our axioms characterize a unique selection criterion that is also useful as a tool for applied comparative statics exercises ... In an experimental test we find a strong predictive power of our proposed criterion.
