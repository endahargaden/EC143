## This module is not Leaving Cert economics

--

But before that, a detour...

---

# What universities do on a daily basis

- Undergraduate instruction (e.g. **this!**)
- Undergraduate supervision (e.g. thesis)
- Postgraduate instruction (e.g. teaching MA students)
- Postgraduate supervision (e.g. PhD students)
- Original research (e.g. journal articles, peer review)
- Engage with society (e.g. patent inventions, advise on policy)
- Day-to-day service (e.g. hiring colleagues, organising conferences)

--

We do lots of things, and it changes every day.

---

## The Leaving Cert curriculum has to be broader

- Approx 70,000 students every year
- Hundreds of schools across the whole country
- Curriculum and exams are set centrally by NCCA and SEC
- Changed perhaps once every 20 years
- Largely becomes a test of **memory**, not _understanding_

---

## Memory is less valuable in the age of search engines

I do not want you to be simply able to Google an answer. 

--

**Your brains are too valuable for memory tests!** Please don't expect cramming the slides will get you a pass.
--

I want you to .hl[understand the material], and be able to adjust it.

<blockquote>Committing definitions to memory is no use, but coming up with your own definitions can be valuable.</blockquote>

Do a little every week. Understanding $\neq$ memorizing.

# "Democracy Does Cause Growth" Acemoglu *et al* (JPE, 2019)

.enda-left[
We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health.

### "Macroeconomic Implications of Covid-19: Can Negative Supply Shocks Cause Demand Shortages?"
### Guerrieri *et al* (AER, Forthcoming)

.enda-left[
Motivated by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, we present a theory of Keynesian supply shocks: shocks that reduce potential output in a sector of the economy, but that, by reducing demand in other sectors, ultimately push aggregate activity below potential. A Keynesian supply shock is more likely when the elasticity of substitution between sectors is relatively low, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is relatively high, and markets are incomplete. Fiscal policy can display a smaller multiplier, but the insurance benefit of fiscal transfers can be enhanced. Firm exits and job destruction can amplify and propagate the shock.

## "Borrowing to Save and Investment Dynamics"
## Xiao (2021)

.enda-left[
During the U.S. Great Recession, investment declined more among firms whose indebtedness increased. Instead of investing, they increased their leverage and expanded their stock of safe assets; that is, they borrowed to save. I model borrowing to save as an optimal portfolio choice when firms face gradually resolving uncertainty, balancing the desire to invest with the need to prevent default. Embedding this into a quantitative general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms, I show that this mechanism can simultaneously generate a sharp downturn and a slow recovery in response to a combination of first- and second-moment shocks.

*What percent of wealth in the United States is held by the bottom 50% of the population?*

* 1.8%
* 6.2%
* 11.8%
* 34.9%

The answer is....

---

# The U.S. is quite an unequal place

.center[.shrink500[![Wealth inequality in the U.S.](i/ineq_us.png)]]

---

## Europe is also quite an unequal place, but less so

# Rich countries redistribute a lot of income


.center[.shrink500[![OECD Change](i/oecd_change_v2.png)]]

---

# Within and between country inequality

1,000 years ago, the world was “flat”. Today, there are large differences both within and across countries.

While both types of inequality seemed to have increased, differences in average income between countries are much larger today than they were in the past.

--

However, *very recently*, that has been declining.

This has a similar feel to the **Kuznets Curve.**

---

# Within and between country inequality

.center[.shrink500[![Global Inc Dist](i/within_between.png)]]

---
# Inequality and growth

We can link growing between-country inequality to the hockey-stick diagram. 

For a very long time, living standards did not grow in any sustained way. When sustained growth occurred it began at different times in different places.

*   The countries that took off economically a century or more ago—UK, Japan, Italy—are now rich. 
*   Why did some countries take off only recently, or not at all?

---

# Timing of growth

Growth take-off occurred at different points in time for different countries:
  * Britain was the first country to experience sustained economic growth. It began around 1650.
--

  * In Japan, it occurred around 1870.
--

  * The kink for China and India happened in the second half of the 20th century.

--

In some economies, substantial improvements in people’s living standards did not occur until they gained independence from colonial rule or interference by European nations. .green[Ring any bells?]

---

# The Technological Revolution

.hl[Technology] = The description of a process using a set of materials and other inputs, including the work of people and machines, to produce an output.

--

By reducing the amount of work-time it takes to produce the things we need, **technological changes allowed significant increases in living standards.**

Remarkable scientific and technological advances occurred more or less at the same time as the upward kink in the hockey stick in Britain in the middle of the 18th century. 

---

# The Industrial Revolution

.hl[Industrial Revolution] = a wave of technological advances starting in Britain in the 18th century, which transformed an agrarian and craft-based economy into a commercial and industrial economy.

For example, today the productivity of labour in producing light is half a million times greater than it was among our ancestors around their campfire.

---

# Environmental Consequences

.center[.fitpage[![Carbon Emissions](i/enviro.svg)]]

Increased production and population growth affects the environment, globally (climate change) and locally (pollution in cities).

---

# Environmental consequences

These effects are results of both 
* _the expansion of the economy_ (illustrated by the growth in total output) 
* _the way the economy is organized_ (what kinds of things are valued and conserved, for example).

The permanent technological revolution may also be part of the **solution**, by making it possible to use less resources to produce more output.

# Capitalism

---

# The textbook has a chapter called _The Capitalist Revolution_

The chapter's title is tongue in cheek.

--

This course focuses on capitalism (over other economic systems) for the simple reason of .hl[economic reality]. We live in a capitalist country.

---

# Please do .hl[not] conflate capitalism with e.g. income inequality

Capitalism is an economic system. We contrast it with other economic systems, like communism.

--

Please don't confuse the system with its consequences.

--

Just as not all Christian religions look the same, not all capitalist economies look the same. There is a literature on the **varieties of capitalism!**

--

So what it capitalism? First, let's talk about what we mean by "systems" and "institutions".

---

# Economic systems and institutions

.hl[Institutions]: the laws and informal rules that regulate social interactions among people and between people and the biosphere, sometimes also termed the rules of the game.

.hl[Economic system]: a way of organizing the economy that is distinctive in its basic institutions. Economic systems of the past and present include: **central economic planning** (e.g. the Soviet Union in the 20th century), **feudalism** (e.g. much of Europe in the early Middle Ages), and **capitalism** (most of the world’s economies today). 

---
# Private property, markets, and firms

.hl[Capitalism] = an economic system in which the main form of economic organization is **the firm**, in which the private owners of capital goods hire labour to produce goods and services for sale on markets with the intent of making a profit. The main economic institutions in a capitalist economic system, then, are private property, markets, and firms.
--

Please remember I want you to understand these concepts not memorize the definitions.

---

# Firms are one distinguishing feature of capitalism

Economic organizations in which .hl[private owners] of capital goods .hl[hire and direct labour] to produce goods and services .hl[for sale on markets] to make a .hl[profit].

Other forms of economic organization coexist with firms in a capitalist economic system, but they are not firms. For example,
* Family or individual production (they do not hire others)
* Nonprofit organizations (they do not seek to make profit or sell their output on a market)
* Cooperatives (labour is not hired, work is done by members)
* Government bodies (they do not seek profit; capital goods are not privately owned)

---

# Key Concepts: *Private Property*, and *Markets*

.hl[Private property] = something is private property if the person possessing it has the right to exclude others from it, to benefit from the use of it, and to exchange it with others. Contrast with "The Commons".

.hl[Markets] = a way that people exchange goods and services by means of directly reciprocated transfers (*unlike gifts*), voluntarily entered into for mutual benefit (*unlike theft, taxation*), that is often impersonal (*unlike transfers among friends, family*). Contrast with self-sufficient family farm.

---

Do you think inequality is higher or lower in countries with more market freedoms?

# The Capitalist Revolution

Capitalism led to growth in living standards because of:

* _impact on technology_: firms competing in markets had strong incentives to .hl[adopt and develop new technologies]
* _specialisation_: the growth of .hl[firms] and the expansion of markets linking the entire world allowed historically unprecedented .hl[specialisation] in tasks and production

Together with the technological revolution, this increased worker productivity.

---

# The Gains from Specialisation

.hl[Specialisation] increases productivity of labour because we become better at producing things when we each focus on a limited range of activities
* learning by doing
* taking advantage of _natural differences_ in skill, talent, and geography
* economies of scale

People can only specialise if they have a way to acquire the other goods they need. In a capitalist society, this is done via markets.

# Comparative Advantage

|  | Production Possibilities |
|----|---- |
|.green[Portugal] | .green[1200 shirts **or** 50 litres of wine] |
| England | 1000 shirts **or** 20 litres of wine |

--

If .green[Portugal] splits its time evenly, how much of both?

If England splits its time evenly, how much of both?

---

# But what about specialisation?

.green[Portugal] has absolute advantage in production of both goods.

--

But is .hl[really, really good] at wine. .green[Portugal] is 20% better at shirt production than England, but **more than twice as good at wine production.**

.green[Portugal] has comparative advantage in wine.

---

# Could Portugal benefit from trading with an inferior nation?

--

## **YES!**

--

Suppose England spends all its time on shirts, and .green[Portugal] spends 90% of its resources on wine.

--

England produces 1000 shirts and 0 wine. Portugal produces 120 shirts and 45 litres of wine. .hl[(Why?)]

--

Then there is 1,120 shirts total and 45 litres of wine.

--
That's more of **both goods**!

---

# Comparative Advantage (cont'd)

All producers can benefit by specializing and trading goods, even when this means that one producer specializes in a good that another could produce at lower cost.

Markets contribute to increasing the productivity of labour by allowing people to specialize.

---

# Let's talk about .hl[causality]

Raindancing and weather

Angrist and Kreuger's _hospitals and health_

--

One obsession of modern economics is disentangling correlation with causation. But we mostly cannot run RCTs. We rely on **natural experiments.**

# Divergence in growth

Not all capitalist economies are equally successful

* _political conditions_: capitalist institutions are regulated by the government
* _the government_ also provides essential goods and services (infrastructure, education)

# Up next: GDP and all that

---

# Consider how macroeconomics is different

--

If you are a **CEO** and you fire an employee, he's no longer your problem.

--

If you are the **President**, that employee is now an unemployed person.

--

In macro, what one person does affects others. The macroeconomy is .hl[interdependent].

--

*One man's spending is another man's income.*

---


# The Circular Flow

The .hl[circular flow] diagram illustrates the interdependence of the macroeconomy.

It is a great example of the interdependence principle at work, providing a conceptual framework for analyzing macroeconomic interdependence.

# The Definition of GDP

Gross domestic product (GDP) is the **market value** of all final goods and services produced within a country in a year.

Irish GDP was about €375 billion in 2020. (GNP is about €100bn less.)

# GDP is three things at once

| GDP is... | Measured By... |
|-----------|----------------|
|Total Spending | $Y = C + I + G + X - M$ |
|Total Output | Sum of value added |
|Total Income | Total wages $+$ Total Profits |

--
You might note an important fact about the above formula, it's equivalent to $$Y +M = C+ I + G + X$$

---

# The Breakdown of Y=GDP

.color1[Consumer spending] is household spending on goods and services.

.color2[Government purchases] of goods and services are total expenditures on goods and services by federal, state, and local governments.

.color3[Investment spending] is spending on productive physical capital (such as machinery and construction of buildings) and on changes to inventories.

Goods and services sold to other countries are .color4[exports]. Goods and services purchased from other countries are .color5[imports].


If we add up consumer spending, investment spending, government purchases, exports and subtract imports, we will get the market value of the goods and services the economy produces—the country’s gross domestic product.

---

# The Total Spending Approach

|		|	Eurozone average	|
|--|:-:|
|	Consumption (C)	|	55.9%	|
|	Government spending (G)	|	21.1%	|
|	Investment (I)	|	19.5%	|
|	Exports (X)	|	43.9%	|
|	Imports (M)	|	40.5%	|


Note: $G$ excludes .hl[transfers].

# Alternative to GDP

GDP clearly misses some crucial elements. Consider the United Nations' **Human Development Index** (HDI)


.center[.fitpage[![HDI ranking](i/hdi.PNG)]]


---

## Higher GDP Is Correlated with Better Life Outcomes

.center[.shrink500[![GDP and satisfaction](i/better_life.png)]]

---

# Recall that GDP is measured at market value

If the price of a good increases by 5%, then (roughly speaking) its contribution to GDP will increase by 5%.

Over time, this could give the wrong impression about GDP growth.

---

# How to calculate an inflation rate

The CSO sends out statisticians to record the price of a basket of goods. They measure the **Consumer Price Index**.

$$ \text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\text{Price This Year} - \text{Price Last Year}}{\text{Price Last Year}} $$

--

In 2002, the Consumer Price Index equalled 82.4. In 2003, it had risen to 85.2. What was the inflation rate between 2002 and 2003?

--

$$ \text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{85.2 - 82.4}{82.4} = \frac{2.8}{82.4} = 0.034 = 3.4\text{%}$$

Just like 0.5 is a lot like 50%, 0.034 is equivalent to 3.4%.

---

# **Real** GDP

If inflation exists, then GDP will nominally grow even though the economy is not producing any additional goods. **Nominal GDP**.

--
If you adjust Nominal GDP for inflation, for example by scaling it down by 3.4%, then you get **Real GDP**.

Real GDP is typically what is used to measure economic growth.

---

# GNP and GDP are usually very similar...

--

...except in Ireland.

GDP measures everything produced **in** a country; 
--
GNP measures everything produced **by the residents of** a country.

--
In Ireland, with a massive multinational base, GDP is much larger than GNP. The .hl[repatriation of profits] explains the difference.

---

# Agenda for today

1. PPP
1. Growth in the Irish economy
1. The impossibility of infinite growth
1. Malthus and technological change


---

# GDP is three things at once:

### Because GDP is simultaneously total spending, total output, and total income, there are three ways to calculate GDP:

* Add up every euro of spending.
* Add up every euro’s worth of output produced.
* Add up every euro of income earned.

--

But as €1 goes further in some countries compared to others, adjusting GDP for the .hl[cost of living] generates what's called a **Purchasing Power Parity** measure. 
--
For example, if Big Macs cost €5 in Ireland and €2.50 to Lithuania, then you can double Lithuania's GDP to compare it to Ireland's GDP. Clearly the basket of goods you use to calculate the cost of living matters here.

## Malthus said something similar in 1798

Malthus held that a sustained increase in income per capita would be impossible. He correctly predicted something like the Famine.

Malthus' view of the world relied on .hl[Diminishing Returns].

---
# Diminishing average product of labour

A .hl[production function] gives maximum output for a given set of inputs. 
--
If we hold one input (land) fixed, and expand the other input (labour), the average output per worker is going to fall. This is the law of **diminishing average product of labour**.

# Malthus' Model

.hl[Key Ideas]
1. Population expands if living standards increase
1. But the law of diminishing average product of labour implies that as more people work on the land, their income will inevitably fall

In equilibrium, living standards will be forced down to **subsistence level.**

Population and income will stay constant.

# Revising Malthus’ Law

3 conditions are required to stay in the Malthusian trap:
* .color1[Diminishing] average product of labour 
* Rising .color2[population] in response to increases in wages
* An absence of improvements in .color3[technology] to offset the diminishing average product of labour

.center[The permanent technological revolution meant that .color3[third condition] no longer holds, and explains why Britain was able to escape the Malthusian trap.]

--

A similar situation may exist with climate change. If we wish to continue to grow, we must use .color3[technology] to deliver that growth.
